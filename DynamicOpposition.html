<p><strong>Dynamic Opposition:</strong> There seems to be a need for  dynamic opposition in order to grow stronger in any organized framework. I seem  to have elected myself as an armchair heretic, pushing against the Standard to  test the temper of the ideas presented.</p>
<p>While this page has not yet been developed fully, I am sharing another of my tales as a placeholder.</p>
<p><strong>Rock  Tugging</strong></p>
<p>If you are  only listening to your unrestrained hungers, it may not be well received by all  parties, always. <br>
  I know  that last part to be true because I spend several decades voraciously pursuing  my (predominately) unrestrained hungers with little consideration beyond that  of an amoeba. </p>
<p>Eventually,  among the dust and debris I stopped to ask why there seemed to be so much  turmoil and carnage all strewn about me - as if somehow a dark cloud constantly  rained failure around me. </p>
<p>Becoming  more introspective, and thus more aware of the reverberations my wakes  generated in passing humans - I finally came to understand that I was NOT a  casual observer (as I had so often imagined) but plunged into this humanity at  every turn - and everything I said or did would ripple out in so many different  directions with ramifications unanticipated (due to having a small world view)  returning these &lsquo;vibrations&rsquo; to their source. Often swamping my vessel in the  countervailing sloshes. </p>
<p>I was very  slow to grasp just how much my actions create reactions (and the long term  prices to be paid). I still fail at this point a remarkable number of times. </p>
<p>Even now,  when I imagine myself to be less Neanderthal than Before, I keep hitting my  forehead on unseen obstacles caused by my unconsiderate choices. I use this  term because inconsiderate implies intent. My issues often seem to be about  failing to realize this action might cause that effect. </p>
<p>It is like  making a cake. &lsquo;Oh, I know what goes in a cake. No need to look at the  cookbook. Hmm this tastes funny. Oh. I forgot the eggs (again??)&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was  the purpose of science - to help us figure out what happens if we move this  small rock propping up the big rock. The people who keep tugging on the small  rock and die when they are crushed beneath the rolling stone were the  unsuccessful scientists. I really am trying to avoid being crushed, but …  calculus is hard, perhaps if I just give this small rock a tug and then run…</p>
<p>Apparently  a &lsquo;scientist&rsquo; that can&rsquo;t grasp numbers or math may be just pretending to be  scientifically oriented. </p>
<p>But, I am  a scientist. I am a practical (v. Theoretical) scientist. I don&rsquo;t have the  patience to do years of calculations to see what might happen - I tend to make  a few educated guesses and then light the fuse and see what happens. </p>
<p>This is  why my life is scarred and dented so. I have lots of experiential information  from surviving these &lsquo;field tests&rsquo; coincident with the limps and lumps obtained  in the process. </p>
<p>Knowing  that my method is likely the cause of most of my difficulties is only slightly  comforting, but it does help me avoid blaming external causes for this  smoldering mess. </p>
<p>I try to  hold on to the fact that as a child, I was only willing to do/agree with things  that made sense to me, and having insufficient data/judgement capacity is just  part of the &lsquo;charm&rsquo; of my exciting life. </p>
