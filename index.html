<p>This is a  meandering journey across the landscape of my life. The stories of my lifetime  are filled with unexpected  turns &amp; twists and leaps &amp; bounds. The audience of my tales has expanded over the years and I have been convinced to put some of my  adventures down for perusal and potential mirth. </p>
<p> A Place to Ponder is a collection of adventure,  mischief, and mayhem and how those experiences influenced me at each stage of  my life. Not only is it a collection of both beautiful and ugly moments but a deep  delve into the struggles against societal norms I have defied for more than  half a century. The intent of the site is to leave a legacy of tales which share my  frantic attempts to fit into a world of expected norms, while revealing the  chaos within. I tie together the power struggles, the lessons learned, the  subconscious shaping, and how my own narratives affect my everyday choices. </p>

<p><strong>These pages will reveal:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quality:</strong> As my awareness expanded, I stumbled  across a book titled <u>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</u>;  a book that really  isn&rsquo;t about motorcycle maintenance and only a thin vein of Zen running through  it. The primary point I got was  Quality was the point of existence. I&rsquo;ve  never looked back.</p>
    <p><strong>Dynamic Opposition:</strong> There seems to be a need for  dynamic opposition in order to grow stronger in any organized framework. I seem  to have elected myself as an armchair heretic, pushing against the Standard to  test the temper of the ideas presented.</p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Belief Systems (B.S.) generally curtails  any further ability to learn about given (faith based) ideas. As a Skepticist I  hope to be able to critically examine various perspectives without being caught  up in the fury and passion of any particular BS.</p>

<p>While this may not be a website for  the masses it is sure to be one that leaves the reader seeing the world from a  different perspective.Â  </p>
