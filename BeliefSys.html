<p><strong>Dear  Ms. Takano,</strong></p>
<p><br>
  Although I  was only in the 6th grade, you made 1966 the most memorable year of my youth.  You demanded more of each student than we ever thought possible, but you only  did it in small bites, so that we scarcely realized that we were nearing the  top of the mountain after following you around on a steep stroll. Our class was  trained and operated using Roberts Rules - there were motions and seconds, we  put forth ideas and voted on them, we called our class the &ldquo;Panel Of Experts&rdquo;,  we designed and produced a monthly school paper, &ldquo;The POE Peeper&rdquo;. This  structure and framework allowed each of us a say in how the group would move  forward, what sort of goals we would develop, who would lead each effort. We  were giddy with power and potential.</p>
<p>You knew I  was an outcast, and kept pulling me into the middle of things, often  reluctantly. I had a problem with authority, which is to say, I didn&rsquo;t like  anyone telling me what I should be doing. I remember being Forced to write my  first poem. So I balked. I made excuses, I produced delaying tactics, but  eventually you told me that I HAD to write the poem that day. I wrote a  wretched thing that made no sense and barely rhymed. Still. It was a poem. Huh.  I bet I could do better than that…</p>
<p>You saw  potential within me even though I was trying my best to hide from the world.  You demanded that I stop floundering and start paying attention to life and  people, try to determine how to carve a course through this messy life. I still  recall with a sting when you pulled me aside. The other kids had warned me - If  Ms. T. has &lsquo;a talk&rsquo; with you, she will make you cry - so I was a bit  intimidated, and you started talking to me, not at me. You bore into the center  of me, and pulled out the shiny center. You correctly delineated my fears and  hopes, berated me for not using the talents that I clearly had available; it  was a painful pep talk and I walked away feeling defeated, but the words  hovered and soften as I trudged homeward. Huh. I had potential. I recall that  day plain as if it were yesterday, and I wanted to thank you for being so  giving, for understanding how tiny minds worked and what to say and do to move  them to a better place.</p>
<p>I was  enclosed in a small place, where we only knew other military kids on the Naval base,  so it was not a broad cross section of America. But your words drove me to pay  more attention to the things and people around me. Instead of my reality bubble  only extending a few feet from my mind, I stretched it, expanded it, and found  myself pondering others, what they felt, how they moved through their life. </p>
<p>As this  expanded attention flexed, I began to notice that those young soldiers had a  strained, haunted look - all of them - while they laughed, joked and tossed  each other in the pool fully clothed. I asked Dad about them and he told me  they were here for R&amp;R - Rest and Recuperation - from fighting in a war in  Vietnam. The look on their faces when they relaxed or thought no one was  watching made my spine tingle in a bad way. </p>
<p>I started  paying more attention to the news, to determine what this &lsquo;war&rsquo; thing was that  would crease such furrows into the foreheads of so many soldiers. I started  asking questions. Soon, I found war to be stupid and wasteful, and started my  55+ year rant against killing people and breaking things for a living. And I  owe it to you for forcing my eyes opened.</p>
<p>Thank you  for awakening my awareness, Ms. T, I&rsquo;ll never forget you</p>
<div class="padding"></div>
<p><strong>First  Impressions</strong></p>
<p>A sudden  realization that all things are not one; that what I am experiencing is not  &lsquo;whole&rsquo; - that there is a splintering of reality into individual components -  ball, table, mommy, doorknob - all of these things did not immediately respond  to my requirements. </p>
<p>The  awareness of this frustrated me - made me slowly understand that I was alone in  the universe and that everything else around me had to be grasped, figuratively  and literally, in order for me to do things that I chose to do. I expressed my  discontent vocally, physically, as I was able.</p>
<p>I suppose  this &lsquo;first growing up&rsquo;, the awareness of otherness, of absolute separateness  from &lsquo;everything else I am aware of that is external of my body&rsquo; is something  most of us just consider &lsquo;identity awareness&rsquo;. I found it devastating. </p>
<p>Apparently,  where I &lsquo;came from&rsquo; I had it all, my whims or needs simply required a shoulder  shrug or a bit of a body fidget. Now? I have to struggle just to not be hungry  or uncomfortable, minute by minute… apparently forever. I realized I needed to  improve the transmission of my requirements.</p>
<p>I steadily  rated the success of each attempt to have my needs met. Crying did grant some  attention, screaming brought the granters more quickly, but often they seemed  frantic, unable to grasp exactly how to meet my requirements, and I noted that  they became easily frustrated when I attempted to only communicate with these  loud protests. </p>
<p>They kept  making particular sounds over and over - mostly with their mouths.</p>
<p>One day it  occurred to me - I should make those sounds - perhaps it would work better than  the screaming requests - just make the same noises they do - and see if I get  fed, changed and rocked any more efficiently… and it WORKED! </p>
<p>The better  I echoed the noises the granters made, the more successfully my needs were met.  I was figuring out how to survive, how to succeed, how to move through this  place full of external things that I couldn&rsquo;t directly control. Mama &amp; Dada  started me on this new idea for expressing my hungers and needs more  effectively.</p>
<p>Eventually  I started stringing together more and more of these mouth-noises the granters  made, delighting them with my ability to move the order of the sounds around  differently, to attach additional meanings to these sounds - meanings that even  the granters had not attached to the sounds previously - and this effect  absolutely delighted them, mesmerized them. </p>
<p>I found  that if I moved the sounds around just right, I could bring people along with  me on a ride - an adventure, a story about what was, and what was not, just  using these sounds effectively, shiftingly, to craft a way of perceiving a  thing, an event, an idea, a stance that they would follow along with me as I  painted. </p>
<p>I could  direct these sounds in ways that made the granters laugh and laugh. This  special noise they made somehow offered me magical access to their inner circle  - they would let me sit and listen to their &lsquo;words&rsquo;, their ideas about things,  because I could entertain them with my &lsquo;words&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Words  became the most magical things in the universe; this golden key to granting all  sorts of access - to things, to places, to people, to ideas, to food … &ldquo;May I  have an apple?&rdquo; &ldquo;What time is dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; </p>
<p>It was a  time of wonder - that so many things inside my mind could be propagated to  other entities, and that there was so much data to be gained by asking these  entities (who seemed to know so much more than I did) what the heck was going  on.</p>
<p>Then, so  soon, I was exposed to the largest of all magic - these mouth-sounds could be  recorded, or WRITTEN DOWN and then recalled later on. </p>
<p>~wait, you  mean I don&rsquo;t have to remember everything everyone, including me says, I can  just write it down and then later it will be there for recall? You mean - if  ANYONE has anything important to relay they can write it down and then all I  have to do is READ IT and I will KNOW IT TOO? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!~</p>
<p>It was  like going from being in a kiddie train that went in an oval track for a few  hundred yards to a continental Amtrak adventure. I could learn whatever I  wanted by simply READING about it. wow. So I did.</p>
<p>I wanted  to know everything. So I read everything. Yes, sometimes I played with kids -  the granters kept making me &lsquo;interact&rsquo; with other humans, cutting deeply into  my research of Everything, but I still gobbled up data at a rapid clip -  reading from 2-10 hours a day almost every day. </p>
<p>For over  20 years I Hoovered data into my young skull full of mush. </p>
<p>Slowly,  too slowly it dawned on me that not all data had the same value. There was  inaccuracies, myths, conjectures-as-truth, suppositions and lies. These  confounded me, and made learning The Truth much more difficult. </p>
<p>I naively  imagined that all people wanted all other people to know The Truth (never mind  that during these years, I spent much time concocting untruths - stories - and  invented explanations that routed punishment around me whenever possible!) -  and dealing with this &lsquo;degree of untruthyness&rsquo; was very frustrating for me.</p>
<p>At 21  years of age, I felt stuck - as though my computer-mind had lots of un-weighted  data  points that did not allow me the  luxury of plucking any given set of them out of my repository and using all  that powerful data to bolster this perspective or that stance. </p>
<p>All seemed  to be indeterminate and free-floating in an continuous sea of possibilities.  Without some fulcrum and lever to determine the value of any given data, what  was the point of the data? I floundered for some time with this quandary - how  to judge the data I had acquired in a way that was profitable?</p>
<p>Words,  which I found to be my salvation, were now my problem - as this vast scattering  of ideas had no judgement system, no value assignments to give them heft, or send  them aloft as very light ideas. </p>
<p>The data  in my head was a moras of information that had no central crux of formulation.  Unforged ideas. Useless data. I had no idea how to proceed, how to somehow  wrestle order and some sort of hierarchical structure to all of this data.</p>
<p>I started  reading books about how to think critically. How to successfully weigh our  impressions and glean the best ideas from these experiences. One of the best  was Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - where much is made of word  choices and how to divide the world in different ways inside the mind.</p>
<p>This  allowed me to conceive of a sort of … internal library of ideas and thoughts -  not really cataloged exactly, but the untested data would all go to the  basement until further data could be found to make them worthy of further  consideration. </p>
<p>This  library of ideas would require an inventory to determine what valuable data  needed to be prominently displayed, and what should be relegated to the  basement. This took some time.</p>
<p>In the  middle of all of my angst and confusion about what is accurate experience, what  is real, what is true, and  how can we  know it - someone made an extended argument for me having no idea what is  really going on. </p>
<p>They  gently opined that forming my thinking in this &lsquo;misguided way&rsquo; may not be as  fruitful as some other methods smart people have used to help them break  through some of the quandaries that I keep discussing. The problem of not  understanding what the hell is going on, and what can actually be accomplished,  and what is pure bullshit.</p>
<p>I, of  course, told that person and several of their cohorts that they were living in  some utopian dream land, and obviously did not have the sort of reverence for  their mind that I had for mine, as unsure as it might be about everything At  This Moment; that consuming a few hundred micrograms of some psychotropic  molecule was NOT the solution to everyone&rsquo;s problems, regardless of how much  FUN they had frolicking around with it in their tangled minds. </p>
<p>They, at  times smugly, at times with very large hearts, continued to assure me that I  was so far off the mark that most of my mouth-noises were inconsequential. This  actually started to irritate me. </p>
<p>Their  superior, Oh-well-I-just-happen-to-know-the-secret-to-the-universe-and-you-DONT&rsquo;  attitude just about made me want to strangle them at times. </p>
<p>They  gently offered me more books by other idiots who had foolishly done the same  thing - crossed that no-man-may-cross-back barrier where you hand your precious  and only one of a kind mind over to some howling vortex for TWELVE FUCKING  HOURS at a time - and hope you come back in one piece. </p>
<p>It was as  frightening as any astronaut being launched in a &lsquo;first try&rsquo; rocket ship - the  difference was - IF the astronaut survived, his trip was a success, whereas I  could come back down and spend the next 40 years &lsquo;unsuccessfully dealing with  the journey&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They kept  purring about the journey being so worth the terror that does not manifest.</p>
<p>Eventually  I fell under their spell and I consumed the potion (see article). I was forever  changed in that night, and by the next day, my library had been somehow  weighted and stacked by some unfathomable method and I saw what mattered and  what didn&rsquo;t - what was valuable and what wasn&rsquo;t. And my life has been so much  better for that shift - as far as I know.</p>
<p>I  attempted to restrain myself around others - OH MY GHOD, I KNOW WHAT IS GOING  ON AND IT IS SO INCREDIBLE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE - the stupid  smugness that had so clearly irritated me when glimpsed was plastered all over  my face. I babbled like a brook about the wonder of existence, the unlikelihood  of a universe, and other useless drivel. I was insufferable for weeks. </p>
<p>Slowly,  the glow faded and I could mostly behave &lsquo;normally&rsquo; around other humans, but I  still wanted to shout at them - WAKE UP AND PAY ATTENTION - problem was in  trying to figure out a way to communicate exactly what it was that I felt folks  NEEDED to pay attention towards. </p>
<p>All I knew  was that life was this vibrant, thrumming aliveness that called to us all each  conscious moment, and it felt like so many of us were sleepwalking through the  mystery and wonder of those preciously poised potentials. I wanted to shake  everyone awake. I still do. </p>
<p>The whole  point of being alive is to experience it as completely as possible. </p>
